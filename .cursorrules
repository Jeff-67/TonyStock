# Instructions

During interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. When receiving a new task:
1. Review the scratchpad content
2. Clear old different task if necessary
3. Explain the new task
4. Plan the steps needed to complete the task
5. Use todo markers to track progress: [X] Done, [ ] Pending
6. Update progress when subtasks are completed
