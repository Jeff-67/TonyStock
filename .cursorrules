# Instructions

During interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. When receiving a new task:
1. Review the scratchpad content
2. Clear old different task if necessary
3. Explain the new task
4. Plan the steps needed to complete the task
5. Use todo markers to track progress: [X] Done, [ ] Pending
6. Update progress when subtasks are completed

# Scratchpad

Current Task: Framework Application Flexibility
Progress: 
[X] Learned to adapt framework based on company specifics
[X] Successfully combined multiple tools for comprehensive analysis
[X] Balanced quantitative and qualitative information
[X] Focused on most relevant aspects rather than covering everything

Key Takeaways:
- Framework serves as guide, not strict ruleset
- Prioritize company-specific important factors
- Tools should support analysis, not drive it
- Balance depth vs breadth based on significance

Next Steps:
- [ ] Continue refining tool usage efficiency
- [ ] Develop better error handling for web scraping
- [ ] Improve integration of financial and strategic analysis
- [ ] Maintain focus on key transformative events

Note: These guidelines should be applied to all future stock analysis tasks.
