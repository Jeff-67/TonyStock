# Technical Analysis Framework Using TA-Lib

## 1. Chart & Indicator Search Strategy

### A. Price Patterns & Trend Analysis
   - **Trend Determination:**  
     * Determine if the stock is in an uptrend, downtrend, or consolidation.
     * Use TA-Lib functions like SMA, EMA to calculate moving averages and define trend direction.
     * Special attention to:
       - 5MA, 10MA for short-term trends.
       - 20MA, 60MA for medium-term trends.
       - 120MA, 240MA for long-term trends.
   - **Support & Resistance Levels:**  
     * Detect key support and resistance zones based on historical price data.
     * Utilize Fibonacci retracements.
     * Observe:
       - Integer levels (e.g., 100, 200) as support/resistance.
       - Previous highs/lows.
   - **Pattern Recognition:**  
     * Identify classic patterns (e.g., head and shoulders, triangles, flags).
     * Use TA-Lib's candlestick pattern functions (like CDLHAMMER, CDLDOJI, CDLENGULFING).
     * Focus on common patterns:
       - Double bottoms/tops.
       - Head and shoulders.
       - Triangle patterns.

### B. Technical Indicators via TA-Lib
   - **Momentum & Oscillators:**  
     * Calculate RSI (TA-Lib function: RSI) to detect overbought or oversold conditions.
       - Focus on 5-day, 14-day RSI.
       - Monitor 80/20 and 70/30 overbought/oversold zones.
     * Use MACD (TA-Lib function: MACD or MACDEXT) for momentum analysis and crossover signals.
       - DIF, MACD, OSC three-line golden/death crosses.
       - Watch for divergence phenomena.
     * Evaluate KD indicator (TA-Lib functions: STOCH, STOCHF or STOCHRSI) for entry/exit signals.
       - Monitor 80/20 overbought/oversold zones.
       - Watch K line and D line crossovers.
     * DMI (TA-Lib function: ADX, PLUS_DI, MINUS_DI) for trend direction.
       - Compare DI+ and DI- crossovers.
       - Use with ADX for trend strength confirmation.
   - **Volatility Measures:**  
     * Apply Bollinger Bands (TA-Lib function: BBANDS) to understand price deviations.
       - Focus on Bollinger Band compression and expansion.
       - Confirm price breakouts above/below bands.
     * ATR (TA-Lib function: ATR) for volatility measurement.
       - Use for stop loss placement.
       - Higher ATR indicates higher volatility.
   - **Volume & Trend Confirmation:**  
     * Use OBV (TA-Lib function: OBV) to analyze volume trends relative to price movements.
     * Volume Rate of Change (VROC).
       - Compare with price movement.
       - Identify volume expansion/contraction.
     * Price Volume Trend (PVT).
       - Confirm trend strength.
       - Watch for divergences.
   - **Additional Indicators:**  
     * ADX (TA-Lib function: ADX) for trend strength.
       - Values above 25 indicate strong trend.
     * CCI (TA-Lib function: CCI) for cyclical trends.
       - Standard 20-period setting.
       - Overbought/oversold at +100/-100.
     * Williams %R (TA-Lib function: WILLR).
       - Complement to KD indicator.
       - Focus on -20/-80 levels.
     * Triple EMA (TEMA) for trend following.
       - Less lag than simple MA.
       - Good for quick trend changes.

## 2. Technical Analysis Framework

   - **Divergence Analysis:**  
     * Analyze price and momentum indicator (RSI, MACD) divergences that may signal trend reversals.
     * Watch for:
       - Bullish divergence (price makes new low but indicator doesn't).
